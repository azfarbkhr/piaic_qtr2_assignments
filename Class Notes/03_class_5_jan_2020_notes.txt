notes 

types of machine learning
Supervised learning 
	sequence generation >> eg: google photos auto caption our photos
	syntax tree detection
	object detection
	Image segmentation 

Unsupervised learning 
this is most used in data anaytics and is used for understanding data
	clustering
	dimensionality reduction >> can also call it feature reduction; to reduce number of unnecessary columns by droping un-corelated columns and merging similar columns

Self-supervised learning
Where we have labelled data but system also marks it own labels

Reinforcement learning
	faltu baatain kar rha hay;
	an agent receives info about environment and takes action to max its reward.
	
glossary for ml/ai >> read from book

Evaluating ml model
	generalizations >> running too many epochs can have adverse impact on accuracy; if we train the model too much then it overfits and model instead of predicting based on general features; it predicts based on specific features

training, validation & test sets >> read from book



Data Representation >> 
the arrow of time
overfitting and underfitting 


Regularization techniques;
- reducing the network's size >>
